# sonicwall_tsr_extract
we are using regular expressions to extract network objects, service objects, network object groups, and service object groups from a sonicwall firewall tsr file.

example terminal usage 

 python sonicwall_tsr_to_excel.py C:/Users/lucidity/Downloads/techSupport_8FF542_11-16.wri

We plan to also extract firewall rules and NAT rules.
